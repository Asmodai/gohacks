# Security Policy

## Supported versions

| Version | Supported          | Notes                     |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Master  | :white_check_mark: | Active development        |
| v0.x    | :x:                | Deprecated, will not fix. |

### v0 Notice

The `v0` series is considered **frozen in time**.  No further updates,
security or otherwise, will be made.

If you're using `v0`, you are doing so at your own risk, peril, and
potentially moral disgrace.

Please upgrade to `v1` unless you're archaeologically studying ancient
codebases.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please file an issue giving as much detail as possible, including the
version (either git tag or commit hash).

If possible (and relevant), please link to a CVE, or to a
vulnerability report.

If there has been a violation of secure programming methodology,
please link to the relevant OWASP (or equivalent) article(s).

If a vulnerability has been accepted, I will attempt to issue a fix as
soon as I can.
