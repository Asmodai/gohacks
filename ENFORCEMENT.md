## Enforcement, the Late ’80s Hacker Way

This project formally adopts the [Contributor Covenant Code of
Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). However, in the spirit of Berkeley UNIX
and the Free Software Foundation, we also recognize that a little
hacker humor keeps the terminals warm.

Therefore, enforcement will *not* be handled by the House Unhackerlike
Activities Committee (HUACom), which has yet to be successfully
`make`d on any system. Instead, it will follow these principles:

- **Don’t be an ass.**  If you are, expect a gentle nudge.
- **No committees.**  We have no “Central Committee for Moral Hygiene.”
  We don't even have a mailing list.
- **Trolls get /dev/null.**  Please direct all flames to
  `/dev/null`, where they will be queued for garbage collection.
- **Respect is portable.**  Works equally well on VAX, Sun-3, and
  x86 (when it finishes compiling).
- **Hack, don’t whack.**  Use your energy for patches, not politics.
  This is a source tree, not Usenet.
- **Be excellent to each other.**  It’s POSIX compliant.

### Final Note

If you actually manage to summon drama, congratulations—you’ve
reinvented Usenet. Please take it there instead. Otherwise, treat
fellow contributors with respect, keep the hacks flowing, and remember:
no one ever debugged faster by being a jerk.
